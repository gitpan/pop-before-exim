This daemon relies on those perl modules:
	File::Tail
	AppConfig
	Sys::Syslog
	DB_File # not actually used, used to be used 
	# for creating on-disk-database, but this makes no sense
	# with small size ( in my setups list of allowed hosts
	# never grows beyond 20-30 )


 Deamon should be run as user capable of reading /var/log/maillog file ( syslog, whatever ),
best solution would be to create user 'pbe' who would be a member of group 'mail', who would
own that logfile.
For example:
	ls /var/log/mail.log -l
	-rw-r-----    1 root     mail        971661 Jun 28 18:07 /var/log/mail.log
	groups pbs
	pbs : pbs mail

Exim configuration.
This line 
	host_accept_relay = "localhost:192.168.0.0/16:lsearch;/var/lib/pop-before-smtp/hosts"
explains itself;)
(One should create /var/lib/pop-before-smtp beforehand, and chown pbs.mail it)


 
pop-before-smtp.conf:
#my $pat = '^(... .. ..:..:..) \S+ (?:ipop3d|imapd)\[\d+\]: ' .
#          '(?:Login|Authenticated|Auth) user=(\S+) host=(\S+ )?\[(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\](?: nmsgs=\d+/\d+)?$';
